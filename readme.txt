= Why do some review ratings stats appear to be delayed? =

Review ratings stats are updated daily from Google's latest search results; however, some stats in the search results might not be updated daily by Google's web crawler, so it might take a few days for the latest stats to be updated.

= Why do some review platforms stats disappear from my review widget? =

Some review platforms might temporarily not appear in Google's latest search results, which can subsequently be reflected on your review widget.

= Why is the list of review platforms sometimes not returned (or shows an error) after searching? =

You can try using other variations of your Brand Name or location. The plugin will list proper results if the Google search results are actually valid for your brand name.
